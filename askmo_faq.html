    <h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>> Why does AskMo look like it time-traveled from 1987?</h2>
        <p>Because it did. We’ve returned to the roots of computing—when terminals were green, computers respected your time, and people didn’t pretend to understand AI.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>> How is this helping make the world a better place?</h2>
        <p>We're reducing distractions, flashiness, and clickbait. This wiki loads faster than your career progression and uses fewer resources than a single Teams emoji reaction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>> Can I submit a suggestion?</h2>
        <p>Sure. Write it down, fold it in half, and file it under “T” for trash. AskMo runs on logic, not opinions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>> What if I don't understand how to use this site?</h2>
        <p>Good. It wasn't built for you. Real ones know.</p>
